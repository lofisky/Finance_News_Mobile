# Finance_News_Mobile

## Project Description
This is the first mobile application I have created as a trustworthy source of financial news, to help keep users up to date with the latest developments to assist with informed monetary decisions. Powered by the .NET MAUI framework, the frontend is built with XAML with integrated SVG images for app icon and splash screen display, and the backend is powered by C#.
